          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>To some extent, income and wealth directly support better health because wealthier people can afford
            the resources that protect and improve health. In contrast to many low-income people, they tend to have
            jobs that are more stable and flexible; provide good benefits, like paid leave, health insurance, and worksite
            wellness programs; and have fewer occupational hazards. More affluent people have more disposable
            income and can more easily afford medical care and a healthy lifestyleâ€”benefits that also extend to
            their children.</p>

          <p>American eople with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care, are more likely to be
            uninsured or underinsured, and face greater financial barriers to affording deductibles, copayments, and the costs of medicines and other health care expenses.</p>

          <p>Regardless the number of population and GDP differences between states, lower-income Americans are less able to afford
            health care services and health insurance.</p>
